# Student Collaborators

I am fortunate to have a group of wonderful students working with me on a variety of topics. Here is an overview of their projects:


## 2015-2016 Projects 
**[Austin Boeck](https://github.com/austin-boeck):** Searching for connection between flares, starspots, and photometric flicker with *Kepler*.

**[Jonathan Cornet](https://github.com/cornetj2):** Comparing flare rates between stars in *Kepler*.

**[Riley Clarke](https://github.com/RileyWClarke):** Flare rates from wide binary stars in the *Kepler* field.
