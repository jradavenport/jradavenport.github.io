My research interests are widespread, and generally involve large datasets of stars, time domain astronomy, and stellar populations. Stars, and more broadly stellar populations, are the fundamental building-blocks of galaxies, and I enjoy the using large databases to understand the history of our Galaxy. 

My [MS thesis](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...711..559D) work was studying the open cluster M67 with a powerful algorithm for separating the cluster population from the background field stars. 

My PhD thesis involves studying flare properties and the 
evolution of starspots using data from Kepler, and 
using this amazing training sample to make 
predictions for what future surveys like LSST will recover. 

**See my [CV](http://goo.gl/vBlVs) or [ADS link](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?return_req=no_params&author=Davenport,%20James%20R.%20A.&db_key=AST) for my most recent work.**

<h3>Questions I am interested in include:</h3>

**1. What utility does the time domain offer studies of Galactic structure/evolution?**

The schematic figure below shows a number of stages/processes in stellar evolution useful for age-dating the Galaxy. As with all age indicators for stars, we use processes that have a temporal dependence. For the LSST era, we seek indicators that require “time-domain” measurements, such as flares and binary star period distributions. I am interested in calibrating these relations, and placing them in the context of this diagram. We will then be able to build a generative age model of our Galaxy, based on observations of many stellar properties and age proxies.

**2. How does stellar activity affect exoplanet habitability?**

Below is a cartoon version of how the flare rate for main sequence stars may change as a function of stellar mass and age. Besides being a unique and powerful age indicator (above), studying stellar activity across the main sequence is critical for understanding the effects host have on their planets. Planet habitability may be greatly impacted by the occurrence rates during key formation phases.
