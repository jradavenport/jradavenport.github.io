My research generally involves large datasets of stars, time domain astronomy, and stellar populations.
Stars and stellar populations are the fundamental building-blocks of galaxies, and I enjoy the using large databases of these tracers to understand the history of our Galaxy.

- **[Available Projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/):** A partial list of available projects for students or collaborators

## Values

- I believe science is a **practice**. We should always be learning and changing our approach to reach the best outcomes.
- I believe in "**Human Centered Project & Mentorship Design**"
- We should strive for, and broadly define, **scholarship, creativity, and collaboration**
- "Perfect is the enemy of the good" -[Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good)


### Practical Items:

- People are the most important piece of our work and our group.
- Discuss careers, strategy, and process openly and without judgement.
- Have a website. A web presence is even better
- Side-projects, wild ideas, "hacks", **creativity** are strongly encouraged.
- We should "publish" as much as possible.
- Publishing is broadly defined.
- We will all be involved in writing papers and grants.
- We will celebrate and document our process, our failures, and our victories.
- A placeholder [GitHub group](https://github.com/TheAstroFactory) we can use for branding if we like.

My projects all live on [GitHub](https://github.com/jradavenport), and I welcome collaboration!
