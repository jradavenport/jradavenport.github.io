- **SETI with ZTF**
	- while optical surveys aren't the typical (or maybe ideal) data source for SETI work, we should mine them nonetheless.
	- am building some broad support/interest from SETI community
	- obvious future potential with LSST
	- idea sketched out [here](http://astro.ifweassume.com//2018/05/21/seti/)
	- definitely a paper worth writing...
