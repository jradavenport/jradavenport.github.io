Collecting project ideas for [Gaia DR3](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3)

[UW Brainstorming Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHenqMYuLmWGH3yHxuGGu1ARgzjXR-w4qdJaBENcCfY/edit#)

- Searching for new PNe in Gaia... spectra could be useful!
- EBHRD
	- Finding the “best eclipsing binaries”
	- if the TESS-based metric is ready, just apply it to Gaia and find the "best" targets
	- **this is what i'm planning to work on first :D**
- SETI-related projects
	- Dyson sphere stuff
	- Outliers in super-color space
	- [Surveying the WOW! Fields](https://github.com/jradavenport/wow_gaia) for variability (play off [this paper](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/an-approximation-to-determine-the-source-of-the-wow-signal/4C58B6292C73FE8BF04A06C67BAA5B1A) some)
	- SETI Ellipsoid, can we compute the SN1987A Ellipsoid crossing time for the entire 2B stars? (via AXS)
- Gaia LC for [QX Cas](https://github.com/jradavenport/QX-Cas) (and other special/weird systems)
- Stellar rotation: Gaia + TESS
	- can we see the rotation period gap?
	- rotation in clusters? (low-hanging fruit??)
- (Re)make textbook figures with new data!
	- literally any textbook has figures that can/should be replicated w/ Gaia!
- Gaia Wilson Bappu (w/ SLH!)
	- already gathering existing HK data ([repo](https://github.com/jradavenport/Gaia-Wilson-Bappu))
	- replicate Wallerstein+2019
	- can we do WBE with the Ca IRT alone?
- Activity Cycles from Ca IRT?
	- competition from [Gaia DR3](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3-papers) team probably
- Everything in its right place
	- stars in CMD in Hiparcos vs Gaia
	- played with this idea in [2018](https://github.com/jradavenport/GaiaSprint2018/blob/master/dr1v2/explore.ipynb)
	- Look for specific star motions across interesting regions of the CMD (**Post-AGB stars**, He Flash, etc)
- Binary star density across galaxy
	- Played with idea in [2018](https://github.com/jradavenport/GaiaSprint2018/blob/master/bin_frac/explore-7Mstars.ipynb)
	- Could be done entirely (initially) on AXS/Epyc
