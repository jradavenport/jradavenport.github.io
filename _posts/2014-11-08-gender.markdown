In 2014, with a great amount of help from friends and volunteers, I undertook a unique study of the gender ratios present in conference talks. We gathered data on the gender of both speakers and questioners from over 270 talks at the 223rd AAS meeting in Washington DC. Our goal is to better understand how and when people ask questions at scientific conferences, and to help define best-practices for conferences to ensure everyone can participate equally

I am very interested in extending this project to future AAS meetings, as well as other scientific conferences. If you are attending/organizing an upcoming conference and wish to collect data to assist with this project, please email me!

Other conferences that have participated so far:
[NAM2014](http://breedingenthusiasms.wordpress.com/2014/06/19/nam-gender-survey/), Cool Stars 18, and AAS 225 (planned)
