## Research Products

- From [Davenport et al. 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...797..122D): the analytic M-dwarf flare model for Kepler data is coded up in IDL [here](https://github.com/jradavenport/FBeye/blob/master/aflare.pro).
 
- From [Davenport et al. 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.3430D): The 10-dimensional stellar color locus, using *ugrizJHK* and WISE bands 1-3. Full machine readable tables are [on GitHub](https://github.com/jradavenport/wise_locus).

- From [Davenport et al. 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...748...58D): Predicted flare colors in SDSS and 2MASS filters for M0-M6 stars. Inlcudes IDL code, and save file, and NUV to IR spectral templates are [here](https://github.com/jradavenport/flare-grid).
