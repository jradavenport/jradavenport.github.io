This guide is a rough draft explanation of how to reduce DIS data from start to finish with *pyDIS*. Note, this entire process is reproduced in the [autoreduce](https://github.com/jradavenport/pydis/wiki/function:-autoreduce) helper function. In this simple example we'll assume you have all the needed calibration files in the working directory, that you are on a linux/mac for a couple shell commands, and that there is only 1 science frame to analyze. We will only do the RED chip in this case. The procedure is identical for the BLUE chip, but due to different Signal/Noise or color of the source some parameters may need tweaking.


Because the code has been evolving, this guide has been moved. In a future version of this page I will have a complete guide including sample data and images...

## Look at the *pyDIS* [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/jradavenport/pydis/wiki/Manual-Reduction-Guide) for the latest version of this guide!
