# Research Project Ideas

Below is a list of project ideas that either A) I am hoping to work on, or B) I would love a student or collaborator to work on! I am putting these ideas online in the hopes of attracting people to help work on them. If you see something you'd like to collaborate on, please reach out to me!


- **Searching for M dwarf flares in WISE**
	- use the NEOWISE light curves
	- pick M dwarfs using J-W2 color
	- use best sampled light curves from polar regions with most visits
	- also look at previously known flaring M dwarfs
		- e.g (UV Ceti, AD Leo, YZ CMi, CN Leo, Proxima Cen...)
	- some looking @ M dwarf variability with WISE [already](http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2012/12/aa19783-12/aa19783-12.html)
- **Recovering differential rotation from *Kepler* light curves**
	- use machine learning to learn features in the periodogram that correlate with differential rotation
	- some more details are at [this blog post](http://astro.ifweassume.com//2015/11/14/diffrot-ml/)
- **Flux calibration of the TESS data**
	- This should be done, but currently is not planned for the TESS full frame images. 
	- some more details are at [this blog post](http://astro.ifweassume.com//2016/01/07/fluxcal-in-tess/)
- **Detailed Properties of Stellar Flares versus Spectral Type**
	- Use flare sample from active stars in *Kepler*
	- Look at classical flare morphology, like in [this paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...797..122D)
	- Look at details of complex flares, like in [this paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IAUGA..2253851D)
- **Could circumbinary exoplanets form very tight (contact) binary systems?**
	- some shaky details for this idea [are here](http://astro.ifweassume.com//2015/12/15/planets-binaries/)
- **Project Dust Storm: Can we see the proper motions of dust within the Galaxy?**
	- could we directly image (e.g. with ALMA) dust moving over a decade-long timeline? (I'm not sure how good ALMA's astrometry is...)
	- could we imply clouds moving due to changes in the foreground dust extinction for background stars/objects over time? 
	- Would be good to do order-of-magnitude calculation about spherical cloud of dust moving...
	- some more details of this longtime pet project [are here](http://astro.ifweassume.com//2015/12/13/duststorm/)
- **How many eclipsing binary stars do we expect to see in an open cluster?**
	- A straight forward numerical question. Take all known probability distributions of stars/clusters/binaries, as well as observability constraints, and multiply them together. 
	- compare to best known catalogs of eclipsing binaries in open clusters (e.g. M67). Do we get roughly the right number?
	- Can we improve constraint on eclipsing binary population statistics (e.g. period distribution) based on results of our forward modeling?
	- a few more details are in [this blog post](http://astro.ifweassume.com//2015/11/15/binaries-in-clusters/)
	- Kepler/K2 data for M67 is [now available](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.459.1060G)
- **Variability studies of the *Kepler* Full Frame Images**
	- working on getting funding for this idea
	- a few details from the AAS 227 Hack Day [are here](http://astro.ifweassume.com//2015/12/04/hackidea2016/)
	- a work-in-progress GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/jradavenport/FFIorBUST)
- **Validating a weird short period Eclipsing Binary**
	- I've got an object with data, and I think I know what it is, but need to analyze the data
	- would help to generate a full eclipsing binary model of the system using PHOEBE or similar
- **PyDIS: The Python-based long slit spectroscopy pipeline**
	- I'm always looking for help on PyDIS! Especially testing, and writing more examples
	- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jradavenport/pydis)
	- [project mantra](http://jradavenport.github.io/2015/04/01/spectra.html)
- **Gender in Astronomy Conferences**
	- Ongoing project that needs help analyzing data!
	- Data is simple to read, basic plots and analysis are needed!
	- More info [here](http://aasgender.wwu.edu)
- **Tricycle: Looking for eclipsing binary systems with two rotation periods**
	- "3 periods, 2 stars, 1 age"
	- Possibly interesting systems from standpoint of "gyrochronology", as well as binary dynamics!
	- working with collaborators at UW ([GitHub project](https://github.com/StellarArmy/tricycle))
- **"Chemical cartography" using SDSS M dwarfs**
	- given huge spectroscopic sample of M dwarfs from SDSS (and now LAMOST), can we use rough [Fe/H] measurements to trace abundances nearby?
	- can we re-cast these [Fe/H] measurements in to more useful relative line measurements, and/or use photometric colors?
	- I started working on this [a few years ago](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22440404W), but have lost steam.
