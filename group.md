I manage a weekly "group un-meeting", which should be viewed as a continuous experiment in supporting my [stated values](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09963) as a practicing scientist. As such, the format is not strict, and will be revised by and for the needs of those attending. Topical areas  are also not strictly defined.


## Details
Meetings are each week for 1 hour: Mondays, 10AM, PAB 305 conference room.

**Monday morning?!** Yes. This meeting aims to be _aspirational_, rather than judgmental. What are you hoping to do or learn this week? How can we help hype you up? What support do you need? Never: justify your existence.


## Values

- I believe science is a **practice**. We should always be learning and changing our approach to reach the best outcomes.
- I believe in "**Human Centered Project & Mentorship Design**"
- We should strive for, and broadly define, **scholarship, creativity, and collaboration**
- "Perfect is the enemy of the good" -[Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good)




Practical Items:

- Discuss careers, strategy, and process openly and without judgement.
- Have a website. A web presence is even better
- Side-projects, wild ideas, "hacks", **creativity** are strongly encouraged.
- We should "publish" as much as possible.
- We will all be involved in writing papers and grants.
- We will celebrate and document our process, our failures, and our victories.
- There is an [email listserv](https://mailman11.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/davenportungroup) to facilitate occasional communication 
- A placeholder [GitHub group](https://github.com/TheAstroFactory) we can use for branding if we like.
