I am in the process of starting a group meeting at UW Astronomy to discuss topics that I have interest and expertise in with other researchers, as well as to provide a structured venue for discussion and collaboration.
My goal for the group is to develop a human-centered approach to science, collaboration, and mentorship. We will study topics including (but not limited to) stellar activity, exoplanets, time-domain research, SETI, tool development, data visualization, and public engagement/outreach.

I have a placeholder [GitHub group](https://github.com/TheAstroFactory) now, and a working title: the Astro Factory

We will have a charter or mission statement, and we will be explicit about mentioning it and updating it as needed.

We will lower the bar to writing and publishing by broadening our scope for defining "publication", and making projects more fun and collaborative.

We will all be involved in writing papers and grants. We will all have a website.

We will celebrate and document our process, our failures, and our victories.
