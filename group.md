I am working to create my own research group. The goal is a human-centered approach to science, collaboration, and mentorship. We will study topics including (but not limited to) stellar activity, exoplanets, time-domian research, SETI, tool development, data visualization, and public engagement/outreach.

I have a placeholder [GitHub group](https://github.com/TheAstroFactory) now, and a working title: the Astro Factory

We will have a charter or mission statement, and we will be explicit about mentioning it and updating it as needed.

We will lower the bar to writing and publishing by broadening our scope for defining "publication", and making projects more fun and collaborative.

We will all be involved in writing papers and grants. We will all have a website.

We will celebrate and document our process, our failures, and our victories.
