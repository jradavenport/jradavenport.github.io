I am currently a NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at Western Washington University, working with [Professor Kevin Covey](http://myweb.facstaff.wwu.edu/~coveyk/).

I received my bachelors of science in physics and astronomy at the University of Washington, a masters of science in astronomy at San Diego State University, and a PhD in astronomy at the University of Washington. I have also worked as a telescope observer at Apache Point Observatory, and interned at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA.

My astronomy research interests include stellar activity, binaries, stellar populations, star clusters, time-domain astronomy, and large-scale surveys. I am particularly excited about using the time-domain astronomy to learn about stellar ages and the history of our Galaxy.

Since 2012 I have run the data visualization and science blog, [If We Assume](http://www.ifweassume.com)

<i class="fa fa-coffee"></i> I also love coffee.
