I am currently a NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at Western Washington University, working with [Professor Kevin Covey](http://myweb.facstaff.wwu.edu/~coveyk/).

Previously I was a graduate student at the University of Washington. My undergrad (bachelors of science) was also at the UW. I then went on to get a masters of science in astronomy at San Diego State University. I have also worked as a telescope observer at Apache Point Observatory, and interned at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA.

My astronomy research interests include stellar activity, binaries, stellar populations, star clusters, time-domain astronomy, and large-scale surveys such as the SDSS, LSST, 2MASS, ZTF, and Pan-STARRS. I am particularly excited about using the time-domain astronomy to learn about stellar ages and the history of our Galaxy.

Since 2012 I have run the data visualization and science blog, [If We Assume](http://www.ifweassume.com)
