I am an outgoing <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5291'>
NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at Western Washington University,
and a new Research Scientist in the [DIRAC Institute ](http://dirac.astro.washington.edu) at the University of Washington.

I received my bachelors of science in physics and astronomy at the University of Washington, a masters of science in astronomy at San Diego State University, and a PhD in astronomy at the University of Washington. I have also worked as a telescope observer at Apache Point Observatory, and interned at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA.

My astronomy research interests include stellar activity, binaries, stellar populations, star clusters, time-domain astronomy, and large-scale surveys. I am particularly excited about using the time-domain astronomy to learn about stellar ages and the history of our Galaxy.

I also love coffee, gardening, and the Pacific Northwest.
