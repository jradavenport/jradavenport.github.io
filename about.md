I am a Research Scientist in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Washington, and a [DIRAC Institute ](http://dirac.astro.washington.edu) Fellow.

I received my bachelors of science in physics and astronomy at the University of Washington (2007), a masters of science in astronomy at San Diego State University (2009), and a PhD in astronomy at the University of Washington (2015). I have also worked as a telescope observer at Apache Point Observatory (2007), and was an intern at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA (2013).

My astronomy research interests include stellar activity, binaries, stellar populations, star clusters, time-domain astronomy, and large-scale surveys. I am particularly excited about using the time-domain astronomy to learn about stellar ages and the history of our Galaxy.

I also love coffee, gardening, and the Pacific Northwest.
