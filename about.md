I am currently a grad student at the University of Washington, pursuing my PhD in Astronomy. My undergrad (bachelors of science) was done at the UW. I then went on to get a masters of science in astronomy at San Diego State University before eventually returning to UW. I have also worked at Apache Point Observatory and interned at Microsoft Research.

My astronomy research interests include stellar activity, binaries, stellar populations, star clusters, time-domain astronomy, and large-scale surveys such as the SDSS, LSST, 2MASS, ZTF, and Pan-STARRS. I am particularly excited about using the time-domain astronomy to learn about stellar ages and the history of our Galaxy.

Since 2012 I have run the data visualization and science blog [If We Assume](http://www.ifweassume.com)
