## Introduction

In 2014, with help from friends and volunteers, I undertook a unique study of the gender ratios present in conference talks. We gathered data on the gender of both speakers and questioners from over 270 talks at the 223rd AAS meeting in Washington DC. Our goal is to better understand how and when people ask questions at scientific conferences, and to help define best-practices for conferences to ensure everyone can participate equally. This study has now been continued at many AAS meetings, and for conferences around the world.

If you are attending/organizing an upcoming conference and wish to collect data to assist with this project, please email me!
