  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A lot of people talk a big game about the need for new and open software tools in science.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4Y55NZH.png" style="width: 700px;" /></p>

<p>On my shelf are at <em>least</em> 4 books that could teach you how to reduce photometric (imaging) data well. There are many tutorials for writing your own aperture photometry pipeline. I even wrote one myself with about <a href="https://github.com/jradavenport/jradavenport_idl/blob/master/simplephot.pro">500 lines of code</a>! This data analysis problem is considered “easy”.</p>

<p>Most of these books, and most people who write simple photo-pipelines like mine, ignore spectroscopy. By adding the wavelength dimension (and losing at least 1 spatial dimension) we make the problem exponentially harder. I don’t know of a good book that walks you through this - if you have one, please send me the title so I can buy it!</p>

<p>The best manual for CCD spectroscopy <a href="http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/ftp/iraf/docs/spect.ps.Z">with IRAF is from 1992</a>, and is seriously helpful. A good “theory” paper on CCD spectroscopy that I’ve used is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ASPC...23..160W">Wagner (1992)</a>.</p>

<p>In my experience, when a practitioner of astronomy wants to reduce spectroscopy, they first seek out another wizard who remembers the order of divine incantations to whisper to IRAF. Then they pray. Then they swear.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-wrong-with-that">So, what’s wrong with that?</h2>

<p>I have two philosophical bones to pick here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Single object, longslit spectroscopy is “simple” data. It shouldn’t be daunting to use, especially when it becomes increasing valueable as a compliment to “Big Photometry”. It’s 2015, there should be a great toolbox for this!</li>
  <li>Data from instruments should come reduced for you! We build (custom made, hugely expensive) general-use instruments so everyone can do science without having to be an optics or electrical engineer. Large surveys know this well: people need to use their data without being a computer scientist or image processing professional. When you build an instrument, build a pipeline!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-brighter-future">A brighter future.</h2>

<p><strong>Introducing: <a href="https://github.com/jradavenport/spectra"><em>pyDIS</em></a></strong></p>

<p>My first goal with <em>pyDIS</em> is to provide a turn-key solution for reducing and understanding longslit spectroscopy, which could ideally be done in real time. So far I have only used data from the low/medium resolution <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu">APO 3.5-m</a> “Dual Imaging Spectrograph” (DIS). Therefore, many instrument specific assumptions are being made. <strong>As of now, the software works for a first-order reduction of data</strong>, and may be good enough for some science purposes!</p>

<p><strong><em>pyDIS</em> can reduce an entire night of DIS data in under 1 minute with almost no button clicking</strong> (provided your data is simple, moderate S/N and you have all the right standards and calibrations…)</p>

<p>I am not an expert Python programmer, nor a deep expert on spectroscopy. I am just a frustrated scientist who wants this tool to exist!</p>

<p>My second goal is to <strong>“put up or shut up”</strong>. I’m tired of people (like me) saying “boo IRAF”, or “we need new tools”, and not building them. That’s why I applaud projects like astropy, emcee, and astroML: they aren’t just complaining, they’re doing. So this is my attempt at doing.</p>

<h2 id="a-call-to-arms">A call to arms.</h2>

<p><em>pyDIS</em> is not done, and not fully stable. Still, I think it’s more complete than most other packages out there for quickly analyzing longslit spectroscopy (well, if you’re using DIS).</p>

<p>I know other spectroscopy pipelines exist, even some <a href="https://github.com/crawfordsm/pyspectrograph">powerful ones</a> in Python. My plea for you is: make them simple to use! Many I have looked at appear too complicated for me to use, especially without a robust worked example (not just a Hello World). Some are basically impossible to use for other instruments (and maybe <em>pyDIS</em> is too…)</p>

<p>It’s is a classic argument: if you write good documentation, people will use your code.</p>

<p>If you hate what I’ve created: good! Make it better, or make something else! Does <em>pyDIS</em> unnecessarily reproduce or ignore functionality from your amazing codebase? Let me know how I can fix that!</p>

<p>If you like what I’ve created: help! Try to use it, send me feedback.</p>

<p>If you’re building a new general purpose instrument: please write a reduction pipeline.</p>
