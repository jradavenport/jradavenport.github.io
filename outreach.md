I am currently the Faculty Director of Outreach for the Department of Astronomy at the University of Washington. In this role I oversee the administration of many UW Astro outreach programs, including the [UW Planetarium](https://astro.washington.edu/uw-planetarium), the [Mobile Planetarium](https://astro.washington.edu/uw-mobile-planetarium), the [Theodor Jacobsen Observatory (TJO)](https://astro.washington.edu/jacobsen-observatory), and serve as an advisor to programs such as [Astronomy on Tap Seattle](https://astro.washington.edu/astronomy-tap). I convene a monthly internal UW Astronomy Outreach roundup meeting, where we discuss the many events and outreach initiatives going on across the Department, and help develop ideas for new programs. 

I also am currently the instructor for ASTR 270, a science communication course where we work to teach traditional astronomy outreach (planetarium shows and public talks) using a blend of sci-comm theory and improv/theater activities.


Some outreach initiatives I have helped create recently include:
* [The Astronomy on Tap Seattle Roadshow](https://jradavenport.github.io/roadshow/)
* Interstellar Insights, a recurring panel at [Emerald City Comic Con](https://www.emeraldcitycomiccon.com)
* [Art Among the Stars](https://astro.washington.edu/art-among-stars-astronomy-x-art-exhibition-2025), an Astronomy x Arts exhibition organized by R. Liu. I presented "[*Astrobiology's Soup Can*](http://jradavenport.github.io/soupcan/)"
* Cosmic Connections, an upcoming collaboration with the Burke Museum.


I am a frequent presenter at local venues, and you can see many of my public talks [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQXilHRGuU&list=PLWutIaedlwKTBicKbLlt51HgdfkzfKM8k). 
**If you'd like to invite me to speak at your event, please reach out!**
