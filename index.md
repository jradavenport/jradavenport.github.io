I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Washington in the Astronomy department, studying time domain, large survey astronomy, and magnetically active stars with *Kepler*. In Fall 2015 I will begin as a NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow. 

I am also the author and creator of the data science and visualization blog [**If We Assume**](http://www.ifweassume.com), which has received national and international [media coverage](http://www.ifweassume.com/p/press.html).
