I am currently a PhD Candidate at the University of Washington in the Astronomy department, studying time domain, large survey astronomy, and magnetically active stars with *Kepler*. 

In Fall 2015 I will begin as a [NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5291) at [Western Washington University](http://www.wwu.edu/physics/index.shtml).

I am also the author and creator of the data science and visualization blog [**If We Assume**](http://www.ifweassume.com), which has received national and international [media coverage](http://www.ifweassume.com/p/press.html).
