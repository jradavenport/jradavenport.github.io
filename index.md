I am currently a PhD Candidate at UW studying Astronomy, studying time domain, survey astronomy, and magnetically active stars with *Kepler*. In Fall 2015 I will begin as an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow. I am also the author and creator of the blog [**If We Assume**](http://www.ifweassume.com), which has received national and international media coverage.
