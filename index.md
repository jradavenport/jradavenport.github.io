Hi, my name’s Jim. 

I’m a PhD Candidate at UW studying Astronomy, currently studying magnetically active stars with Kepler. I am also creator of the blog [If We Assume](http://www.ifweassume.com) that has received national and international media coverage. I will finish my PhD in spring of 2015. If you’re interested in collaborating, or have any questions, [drop me a line](mailto:jrad@astro.washington.edu)!
