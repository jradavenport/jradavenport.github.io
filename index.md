I am a [NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5291) at [Western Washington University](http://www.wwu.edu/physics/index.shtml). Previously I was a PhD Candidate at the University of Washington. My work focuses on studying time domain, large survey astronomy, with an emphasis on magnetically active stars in *Kepler*. For the latest results of my research see my [CV](http://goo.gl/rM1fb8) or [ADS page](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?return_req=no_params&author=Davenport,%20James%20R.%20A.&db_key=AST).

I am also the author and creator of the data science and visualization blog [**If We Assume**](http://www.ifweassume.com), which has received national and international [media coverage](http://www.ifweassume.com/p/press.html).
