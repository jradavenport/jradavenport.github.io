I am Research Scientist with the [DIRAC Institute ](http://dirac.astro.washington.edu) at the University of Washington's Department of Astronomy.
My research program focuses on studying time domain, large survey astronomy, with an emphasis on magnetically active stars in surveys like Kepler, ZTF, and TESS.
